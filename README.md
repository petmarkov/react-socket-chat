## Installing and Running Locally  

1. Navigate to project root directory

```

cd react-socket-chat

```
2. Install the Dependencies

```

npm install

```
3. Start Server first

```

npm run start-server

```

4. Start Client App in a separate Process

Open a new terminal/shell/console window in the same root directory and Start Client:

```
cd react-socket-chat // if you aren't already in the Project root

npm run start-client

```

App should start running on your localhost:3000

### Changing Server Port

Currently server port for sockets is hardcoded to 3001. In order to change it you need to edit the server and client index.js files

```javascript

// server socket at ./chat-server/index.js line 1

const  io = require("socket.io")(3001);

// client socket at ./src/index.js line 18

export  const  socket = io("http://localhost:3001");

```
